/// with multiple vintages we always mint/retire tokens from the oldest vintage.

/// When a project is created, we take the total supply of the credits available (entire supply in the registry), then as the originator
/// chooses, tokens can be minted for each credit at once or in a staggered manner. In every mint, the `minted` count is incremented and

///    - `minted` is always less than or equal to `total_supply`
///     - `retired` is always less than or equal to `minted`
